								W3 Applications Inc. Privacy Policy<br/>
                                <br/>
                                This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use or setup an account on A+ Points (the “App”).<br/>
                                <br/>
                                PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br/>
                                <br/>
                                When you use or setup an account on the App, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your IP address and time zone. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”<br/>
                                <br/>
                                When you setup an account through the App, we collect certain information from you, including your name, family name, your children's names, email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Account Information.”<br/>
                                <br/>
                                When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Account Information.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br/>
                                <br/>
                                We use the Account Information that we collect generally to:<br/>
                                Communicate with you;<br/>
                                Allow you to login to the App; and<br/>
                                When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our App (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the App, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).<br/>
                                <br/>
                                SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br/>
                                <br/>
                                We may share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                BEHAVIOURAL ADVERTISING<br/>
                                As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications we believe may be of interest to you.

                                If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted.
